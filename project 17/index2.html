            <p class="card-text">Cats are fascinating creatures with distinct characteristics:

                Independent Nature: Unlike dogs, cats are known for their independent streak. They often enjoy their alone time but can be very affectionate when they choose.
                
                Agility and Grace: Cats are incredibly agile and have excellent balance, often landing on their feet thanks to their flexible spine and keen sense of balance.
                
                Cleanliness: They are meticulous groomers, spending a significant portion of their day cleaning themselves with their tongue.
                
                Curiosity: Cats are curious by nature, often exploring every nook and cranny of their environment.
                
                Communication: They have a range of vocalizations—meows, purrs, hisses—to communicate with humans and other cats.
                
                Playfulness: Even adult cats retain a playful side, often enjoying chasing toys or laser pointers.
                
                Territorial Behavior: Cats can be quite territorial, marking their space with scent glands located on their face, paws, and tail</p>
